# Upgrade from 8.x to 9.x
Version 9 is a MAJOR update to dcrypt.
It removes all legacy crutches and moves to use more a more modern design.

- All data encrypted with AesCtr and AesCbc prior to 9.0 will not be decryptable in 9.0.
- OpenSSL based decryption wrapper functions no longer need to pass the `$cost` parameter.
- All hashes stored with `Hash` are now obsolete.
- Hashes generated by `Hash::make` are now 52 bytes instead of 64

# Upgrade from 7.x to 8.x
The encryption function wrapper class `Aes` has been renamed to `AesCbc`.
Rename all references in your code to the new class.
